# SimonSays

The game starts automatically if you start the app

On the screen you see four different colored buttons and a keyword with the phrase "Simon says"

Following Keywords are possible:
 > Color
 > Purple
 > Orange
 > Green 
 > Blue

If "Simon says" Color you have to press the Button that matches with the color of the background.

The System changes the color of the background within every round.

If "Simon says" Purple, Orange, Green  or Blue you have to press the button colored in the 
corresponding color.
  
If you press the right button, the system loads the next task.

If you press the wrong button, the system shows "Game over!" on each button, except the button
you pressed, which changes to a "Restart" button --> you see what button was wrong.

The game runs 20 rounds, indicated by a counter on the top right corner. If you played all 20
rounds without an error, the system shows "You win!" on each button, except the last button 
you pressed, which gives you the option to restart again.
